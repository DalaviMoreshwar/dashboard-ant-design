# Real Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle states that a component should have one, and only one reason to change. It helps in:

- **Reduce Complexity:** Dividing components into smaller, more focused parts makes it easier to understand and manage the code.
- **Enhance Reusability:** When components are focused on a single task, they can be reused across the application and even across different projects.
- **Facilitate Testing:** Smaller components with single responsibility are much easier to tests.
- **Improve Maintainability:** When bugs arise and they will, you can pinpoint issues faster in well-organized codebase that follows single responsibility principle (SRP).
